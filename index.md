## The importance of modifying aerosols in Miocene Simulations

### Motivation
1. Past climate states are different from today and provide evidences of how climate processes operated across states that span the range of $CO_2$ concentrations (400~2000 ppm) associated with future emissions scenarios. (Tierney et al. 2020)

2. The latest generation of climate models with state-of-the-art parameterizations of cloud micro-physics and cloud-aerosol interactions raised the issue of dust and aerosol effects in Paleoclimate simulation. (Sagoo & Storelvmo, 2017) 

3. PlioMIP (Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project) provided us a chance to improve our understanding of climate sensitivity and environmental consequences under the scenario of atmospheric $CO_2$ concentration near 400 ppm. (Haywood et al. 2016; Haywood et al. 2020)
   - More temporally consistent boundary conditions and forcings are used within models. (ex: land-ice surface topography, ocean bathymetry, land surface cover etc.)
   - Pre-industrial aerosols are prescribed in their simulations

4. The research in Miocene, an epoch when the earth had higher $CO_2$ concentration, less ice sheet, and larger continental greening than Pliocene, is still in progress.
   * What are the dust and aerosols effects in Miocene simulations?
   * Whether the modification of prescribed aerosols is critical in paleoclimate simulations?

### Experimental Design

* Modified aerosols (Heaven et al. 2014)

* Modified aerosols in our cases

### Preliminary Results

<b>Caveat: We cannot attribute the responses of surface temperature to dust or specific species of aerosols 

### Results & Code Description
* Variables comparison: TS, Net flux (SRF, TOA), Precipitation, Cloud Fraction, AOD…
* Composite: 
1. What does precipitation and surface temperature patterns look like when concentrations of dust or aerosols are high or low in some regions (ex: Sahel)? 
2. ENSO in Miocene simulations. (Oldeman et al. 2021; Pontes et al. 2022) – ENSO in Pliocene
