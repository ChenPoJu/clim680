## Surface Temperature

<b>Caveat: We cannot attribute the responses of surface temperature to dust or specific species of aerosols 

* Variables comparison: TS, Net flux (SRF, TOA), Precipitation, Cloud Fraction, AODâ€¦

## Net Flux at TOA
* (Shortwave - Longwave): Downward Net Flux at TOA


## Net Flux at Surface
* (Shortwave - Longwave - Latent Heat - Sensible Heat): Downward Net Flux at Surface


## Cloud Fraction: Total/High/Low
